## üíª Steps to Run Locally

### Prerequisites
* Node.js (v14+)
* npm or yarn
* A running instance of MongoDB (Local or Atlas)

### 1. Backend Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR GITHUB REPO LINK]
    cd college-dashboard-backend
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    ```
3.  **Configure environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your database connection string and port:
    ```
    PORT=5000
    MONGO_URI="YOUR_MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING"
    ```
4.  **Seed the database:**
    The backend includes a script (or runs on initial connection) to seed the `colleges` collection with the sample dataset.
5.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The API should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

### 2. Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ../college-dashboard-frontend
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    ```
3.  **Configure API URL:**
    Create a `.env` file in the frontend root and set the API base URL:
    ```
    REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
    ```
    *Note: If testing with the deployed backend, use the hosted API link here.*
4.  **Start the client:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
